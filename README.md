# dotfiles
Collection of my dotfiles and config scripts including my vim config 

## Vim 

My vim config will automatically install `vim-plug` in order to managed plug-ins. There are a few different ones used, but I chose to leverage vanilla features where possible, such as: 

- vimscript-based autoclose of common elements 
- `netrw`-based file explorer with similar UI to NERDtree (but more lightweight) 

Bonus: This works on iOS via the [iSH App](https://github.com/ish-app/ish).
